# Think Tank

Think Tank is a study application designed to simplify the process of students creating dedicated study groups outside of the classroom.

Create Private or Public Groups:
You can create your own private or public study groups, allowing you to share notes, files, and communicate with fellow students in a focused and organized environment.

No More Social Pressure:
With Think Tank, you donâ€™t have to worry about the social pressure of asking other students if they want to study together or attending intimidating office hours with your professor.

Discuss Any Subject:
Whether you have a shared interest in a specific subject or just want to improve your academic standing, Think Tank allows you to discuss and collaborate with others, regardless of distance.

Join Think Tank and give your brain the workout it deserves! Take a swim in the sea of knowledge and enhance your learning experience with ease.
