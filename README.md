# Think Tank

Think Tank is a study application designed to simplify the process of students creating dedicated study groups outside of the classroom.

Create Private or Public Groups:
You can create your own private or public study groups, allowing you to share notes, files, and communicate with fellow students in a focused and organized environment.

No More Social Pressure:
With Think Tank, you donâ€™t have to worry about the social pressure of asking other students if they want to study together or attending intimidating office hours with your professor.

Discuss Any Subject:
Whether you have a shared interest in a specific subject or just want to improve your academic standing, Think Tank allows you to discuss and collaborate with others, regardless of distance.

Train Your Brain:
Join Think Tank and give your brain the workout it deserves! Take a swim in the sea of knowledge and enhance your learning experience with ease.
